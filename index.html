                <!-- Foreword -->
                <section>
                   
                    <h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>
                    <p>The Impact and Innovation Unit is made up of highly skilled, dedicated public servants striving to deliver the best policies and programs, by taking a “mission-driven” approach to transforming government. Our central hypothesis is that by being relentless in our focus on outcomes-based methods and working horizontally across government and sectors, we can achieve better, measurable outcomes for Canadians. For those who work with and within government, you know that’s not always the way we work.</p>
                    <p>We understand that we’re stewards of public funds and the responsibility that carries. As such, it behooves us to modernize our policy and program approaches so that they are focused on achieving our collective outcomes, demonstrate value and meaningful impact. To this end, we’ve continued to take an active role in the global movement of governments that are working to mainstream methods like challenge prizes, behavioural insights, pay-for-performance and pay-for-success funding models. The promise of these methods is that it focuses efforts not on the process or outputs of a program, but rather on clearly defining the sought after outcome and ensuring there is a multisectoral approach to achieving it. </p>
                    <p>These approaches require new partnership models where government, not-for profit and private sectors need to work very differently together. We strongly believe that robust engagement, co-design, and co-development is the best path to get us there. </p>
                    <p>2018-2019 was our first full year of operations under Impact Canada, our main platform for undertaking this work. With the help of domestic and international partners, we spent a lot of time developing and refining methodologies to ensure the approaches we are taking are sound, evidence-based and rigorous by design. This type of work requires much more effort than traditional ways of working, but we feel confident that it is worth it. </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="lead h2 mrgn-tp-0">“This type of work requires much more effort than traditional ways of working, but we feel confident that it is worth it.”</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Not surprisingly, government as a whole is not ready for this at scale, but we have seen important pockets of readiness. Change is hard and can be unsettling for some. Our collective perception of risk is not calibrated appropriately. We shouldn’t equate new with risky. Rather, we need to constantly question status quo, understand the risks of maintaining it, and recognize when we need to responsibly test something new to achieve the desired policy objective. Ultimately, we need to adopt a more iterative approach to policy/program design and delivery. </p>
                    <p>We continue to work hard to move from concept to implementation, and to show what is possible and gain wider acceptance of these methods.</p>
                    <p>We’re still in early days and don’t have enough concrete outcomes, but there have been important process improvements. We’ve also received positive feedback from our external stakeholders regarding this new “look and feel” of government. Moreover, we have indications that the methods we use are attracting non-traditional players, on the premise that new players can lead us to better solutions not previously contemplated. </p>
                    <p>These methods are not silver bullets and are not the answer to every public policy challenge. We have been deliberate in project selection to cover social, economic and environmental policy areas, big and small, so that as we move to impact assessment, we will have a better understanding of what works, for whom, and under what circumstances. It’s why we are also developing new impact measurement methodologies to assess progress so that we can continuously learn and improve. </p>
                    <p>The past year has been filled with excitement, promise and lots of hard work. As such, I want to personally thank my team and other colleagues in the Privy Counil Office, Agriculture and Agri-Food, Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Correctional Services Canada, Crown and Indigenous Relations, Employment and Social Development, Finance Canada, Fisheries and Oceans, Health Canada, Heritage, Indigenous Services, Infrastructure, Natural Resources, Public Safety, and Treasury Board Secretariat. Also, a huge thanks to our Advisory Committee and all of our external partners that have collaborated and helped guide our work.</p>
                    <p>Looking forward to another excellent and productive year as we all continue to work towards making the lives of Canadians better.</p>

                    <p>Since its launch in 2017, the Impact and Innovation Unit (IIU) has remained focused on working with federal departments, other levels of government, and external partners to support the implementation of inventive programs and services designed to improve social, economic, and environmental outcomes for citizens. In particular, the IIU focuses on improving outcomes for citizens by using a set of innovative approaches designed to achieve greater public value in program and service delivery. The IIU seeks to engage a diverse range of actors to help solve societal problems, focus on initiatives/experiments that lend themselves to measuring impact in a rigorous way, and strive to maintain high standards and validity in applying these instruments. The principal approaches that the IIU uses to support Government of Canada departments are challenge prizes, pay-for-success funding models, and behavioural insights.</p>

            <p>Chaired by Ilse Treurnicht, the Committee brings together a distinguished group of senior leaders from the private, philanthropic, not-for-profit, and academic sectors. Its mandate is to provide advice to the IIU on emerging trends and best practices to inform how public programs could enhance their impact through the use of innovative funding approaches (such as challenge prizes, pay-for-success structures, and impact investing), behavioural insights, and rigorous measurement and evaluation techniques.</p>
            <p>Drawing from both Canadian and international experiences and lessons learned, the Committee is helping the IIU identify its unique role in the global innovation ecosystem. Closer to home, the Committee also continues to play a critical role in the development of a strategic plan that will guide future work and identify trends that the IIU can take into consideration as it continues to work to support departments across the Government of Canada.</p>

                    <p>To help achieve the Task Force on Public Sector Innovation’s mandate, Deputy Minister members recruited a cohort of 18 talented public servants known as Government of Canada Entrepreneurs (GCEs), who are full members of the Task Force. The creation of the GCEs themselves is an example of important efforts to upskill the federal public service and build the capacity required to support experimental programming.</p>
                    <p>Working in small, diverse teams across departmental lines, the GCEs are experimenting with new ways of advancing projects that do not have a natural home within a specific department or agency. Their role as ambassadors for innovation is raising awareness and inspiring public servants to apply new tools and approaches to their work. As an added benefit, the GCEs receive leadership training and support from Nesta’s States of Change, a public sector innovation learning approach designed to strengthen innovation capacity across governments.</p>

            <h3>Advancing Cleantech Solutions</h3>
            <p>The IIU has supported Natural Resources Canada in investing $75M over four years in a series of clean technology challenges to unlock breakthrough cleantech solutions to complex and persistent barriers in discrete areas.</p>
            <h4>3.1.1 (b) Spotlight: Women in Cleantech Challenge</h4>
            <p>Launched in collaboration with MaRS Discovery District, this challenge prize supports the representation of women in the cleantech sector. Following a national call and expert selection process, the Women in Cleantech Challenge identified six women to participate in an intensive three-year program, during which they are provided with business advice, and the technical and financial support they need to grow and succeed as cleantech entrepreneurs, including unprecedented access to federal labs and researchers. At the end of the program, the most promising project will receive a $1 million grand prize.</p>
            <p>The jury had planned to name five finalists, but included six because of the high-calibre of ideas presented.</p>

            <h3 class="mrgn-tp-0 mrgn-bttm-lg" id="drugChecking">3.1.2 (a) Responding to Canada‘s Opioid Crisis</h3>
            <p>Canada is in the midst of a public health crisis as it relates to the use of opioids and overdose deaths. The number of overdoses and deaths caused by opioids, including fentanyl, has risen sharply and continues to rise. More than 10,300 apparent opioid-related deaths occurred between January 2016 and September 2018. Among the 3,286 deaths that occurred between January and September 2018, 73% involved fentanyl or fentanyl analogues. It has never been more important to understand the composition of illegal drugs, and to intervene where we can to save lives.</p>
            <p>In partnership with Health Canada and others, the IIU is working on projects to accelerate action on innovative approaches to harm reduction and treatment. In October 2018, the Drug Checking Technology Challenge was launched to incent the development of accurate, portable, and affordable opioid testing technology to reduce harm to those who use drugs. In March 2019, a Jury – comprised of scientists, front line service providers, people with lived and living experience, and entrepreneurs – selected nine semi-finalists from a robust number of applications. These semi-finalists received $25K in funding and advanced to subsequent rounds of the Challenge. The opioid testing technologies of this Challenge encompass new approaches to using existing technologies, or new and novel technologies, which may allow for more widespread deployment to people who use drugs. </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p class="lead h3 mrgn-tp-0">Most of the 24 applicants to the Challenge were new to government, having never been funded through Health Canada‘s Substance Use and Addictions Program.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The past year was spent planning this challenge prize, starting in a very definitive place for exploration – looking at better protection from opioids for first responders – and ultimately landing in a very different direction. What changed our course? Constant citizen engagement in the planning process. A video illustration of the process by which an idea becomes a challenge prize was developed, using the Drug Checking Technology Challenge as an example.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the IIU, Health Canada and other key partners in the clinical and financial sectors have been collaborating on a feasibility study examining and developing pay-for-success approaches for treatment options for opioid use disorder. We are seeking to understand what important gaps may be filled in service provision for those at highest risk of overdose, and the role for pay-for-success or social finance approaches in improving access to and outcomes for the treatment of opioid use disorder. The feasibility work will be completed in July 2019.</p>

            <h3 class="mrgn-tp-xl">3.1.2 (b) Indigenous Homes Innovation Initiative</h3>
            <p>Indigenous peoples experience some of the worst living conditions in Canada, and limited access to transitional or supportive housing options. Current programming for housing at Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) primarily provides needs-based funding, focused on immediate needs and emphasizing rapid construction. Given this reality, building designs are not always well-adapted to the full spectrum of geographic and cultural settings for which they are intended. Indigenous partners have identified the need to test innovative solutions that may support systemic long-term change and improvements to current programming.</p>
            <p>To this end, in partnership with ISC, the IIU spent much of the past year working on a challenge prize that aims to improve outcomes through the co-creation of new and meaningful partnership models with Indigenous communities and civil society to address key socioeconomic issues related to housing. Launched in April 2019, the Indigenous Homes Innovation Initiative will provide up to $36M in new funding to improve socioeconomic outcomes related to housing for Indigenous Canadians. Co-created with an Indigenous Steering Committee, the Initiative will allow ISC greater flexibility in how funding dollars are used to support outcomes more holistically and more broadly reach Indigenous Canadians where they live. </p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>For the first time, ISC will be able to incubate ideas taken in at any starting point but with good potential for impact, and see them through to fruition with the support of professional resources, through an Accelerator component of the Initiative. It is expected that up to 24 Innovators will participate in the Accelerator, with a minimum of 15 ideas going to construction over the next several years. These builds will be houses, housing units, or temporary living spaces. Builds will occur across the country, will be undertaken by all three distinction-based groups – First Nation, Inuit and Metis Nation – and will take place both on- and off-reserve. The Steering Committee will make recommendations for Accelerator participants in November 2019. </p>

            <p>The IIU works with federal departments and agencies, provincial and municipal governments, and the non-profit sector to apply behavioural insights to public policy challenges. Behavioural insights (BI) is the application of findings of psychology, economics, and other social sciences to the work of organizations, including governments. Practitioners commonly test these insights using rigorous experimental methodologies to understand what works in driving better public policy outcomes for Canadians. </p>

            <p>In last year’s annual report, the IIU highlighted the integration of a Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) sign-up service into the Ontario online birth registration service. The results from this integration have been very positive as 70-75% of new parents are scheduling appointments to open an RESP in Ontario. To help more Canadian families start saving early for post-secondary education, the IIU will continue to work with Employment and Social Development Canada and our provincial and territorial partners to scale this service. </p>
            <p>In addition, the IIU has partnered with the City of Toronto to use BI principles in their communications with families in receipt of social assistance to help further increase Canada Learning Bond uptake. The results from this randomized controlled trial will be available in the summer of 2019.</p>

            <p>As part of Trial 1, Heart &amp; Stroke sent close to a quarter million emails to Canadians that had never donated to the charity.</p>
            <p>The trial tested the following BI principles: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Overhead Aversion - Studies have shown that donors give more and in larger amounts when they know that all of their donations are funding charitable programs.</li>
                <li>Goal Completion - Research suggests that people feel compelled to complete tasks if they are presented as part of an incomplete set of tasks.</li>
                <li>Social Matching - Providing social information of past donors has been shown to encourage charitable behaviour.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The trial found that the offer of matching funds resulted in 3.5 times the number of donations, when compared to a control group.

            <h3 id="measuringImpact">3.3 Measuring Impact by Design</h3>
            <p>As the work of the IIU is premised on improving outcomes for citizens, impact measurement is a core element and is embedded in the IIU’s work. Whether the motivation is to improve specific results in the context of pay-for-success arrangements, or a more general need to better understand what works in the area of public sector innovation, impact measurement supports every aspect of the IIU strategy. Fundamentally, measuring impact is about being open and accountable and helps to show others that things cannot only be done differently, but can also achieve greater impact. If this can be done, there is a better chance of building momentum across government to adopt novel approaches to programming in a broader, more systematic, and ultimately more impactful manner.</p>
            <p>To this end, over the past year, the IIU published the first edition of its impact measurement guidance, Measuring Impact by Design. This was produced as core advice that can be drawn upon to ensure work on pay-for-success initiatives across government is supported with credible impact evaluations that help to account for the impact that takes place, but also to learn what works in the growing area of innovative finance. It clarifies what is meant by ‘impact’, and illustrates the range of methods the IIU and partners can use to measure it, drawing on contemporary thinking about impact evaluation.</p>

            <h2 id="lookingAhead">4. Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>Drawing from our past year’s experiences, lessons learned, and what has been said by key stakeholders and informants, the IIU’s areas of focus for the coming year include:</p>
            <h3>4.1 Smarter Implementation of Outcomes-Based Models</h3>
            <p>The IIU will continue to work with its federal and external partners to build the evidence-base around effective and efficient implementation of innovation methods that focus on achieving outcomes (i.e. behavioural insights, challenge prizes and pay-for-success instruments) to improve program and service delivery in the federal context. This includes providing ongoing support to its flagship program streams and current roster of projects.</p>
            <p>In addition, Budget 2019 announced over $320 million in new funding, including:</p>
            <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-tp-lg mrgn-bttm-lg">
                <li class="flex-inline mrgn-bttm-lg"><img class="mrgn-rght-lg" style="width:69px;" src="images/icons/37_1.svg" alt="icon of a house">

                </li>
                <li class="flex-inline mrgn-bttm-lg"><img class="mrgn-rght-lg" style="width:69px;" src="images/icons/37_2.svg" alt="icon of a partly eaten chicken drumstick">

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4.2 Behaviourally Informed Policy and Program Design</h3>
            <p>The IIU will continue supporting departments with behavioural insights expertise as they launch new programs and services in a variety of areas.</p>

            <h3>4.3 Expanding the Impact Canada Fellowship Program</h3>
            <p>The IIU is working with Statistics Canada to develop and launch a Data Science stream. In addition, we are looking to expand the program to other levels of government and discussions for placement opportunities with provincial, territorial, and municipal levels of government are underway. </p>

            <h3>4.4 Developing Case Studies and Knowledge Products</h3>
            <p>The IIU is developing case studies exploring lessons learned to date that can inform future work and other knowledge products related to its outcomes-based funding work. These efforts are contributing to the domestic and global evidence base that is resulting in a more effective use of these approaches.</p>

            <h3>4.5 Systems-Level Transformation through Leadership and Strategy </h3>
            <p>The IIU will continue to experiment and test innovative approaches at an organizational level through its ongoing support of the Deputy Ministers Task Force on Public Sector Innovation. The IIU will also remain focused on working with central agencies, departments, and external organizations to enable systems-level change, including by reducing barriers to innovation inside government; promoting, enabling, and delivering experimentation throughout government; and bringing in the perspectives and expertise of those outside government. The IIU’s work will continue to be informed by the advice provided by the Impact Canada Advisory Committee. A key area of focus for the coming year is the development of a strategic plan that will guide future work. </p>

            <h3>4.6 Seeking Out New Partners and Removing Barriers to Collaboration</h3>
            <p>No one team holds all of the expertise or ideas needed to solve some of society’s greatest challenges, which is why the IIU strives to bring together a diverse range of partners to advance results-driven action that yields greater public value through new and enhanced program and service delivery. The IIU will continue to take a collaborative approach to partnership, recognizing that each partner has a unique set of resources to offer to the partnership in order to add value to the end product.</p>
            <p>In some cases, we have acted as brokers, bringing together departments with the right types of third-party intermediaries (outside of government) who can help them get from idea to launch. In other cases, the IIU takes a hands-on approach to co-creation, and works actively to bring other departments and partners to the table to jointly plan, design and bring to fruition a pay-for-success project.</p>
            <p>Understanding our partners‘ resource capacity and desired way of working will help us to provide better advice and services.</p>
